    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I think there are 2 difficult things in programming. One is to name a variable, the other is version control. This blog mainly focusing on solving the later problem using git. Due to the complexity of real problem and human nature, we don’t always know what we want clearly. It’s often that we go back and forth, modify the code and modify it back. It’s hard and tedious to keep track and organize, which will eventually hurt our efficiency. Luckily, we can use Git to help us. Git Cheetsheet Intro to GitGit is a distributed version control system developed by Linus (the guy who also initiated Linux). The workflow of git shows as below. images are adopted from git -the simple guide RepositoryCreate mkdir folder cd into the folder git init you can use ls .ah to check, there should be a .git folder created, believe me, you don’t really want to modify it. Add filesubmit was divided into two steps, first add then commit tell Git that you want to add file to repository, this will add the modified file in workplace to stage ( you may image it as a cache) 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334 git add filename``` 2. tell Git that you want to submit, this add the stage file to repository```bash git commit -m "wrote a readme file"``` note: - words after `-m` are description for this submit, if you don't want to add any description, you should change the parameter, but I won't tell you here :-), google it if you really want- you can add more than once and then submit all of them- every time you modified a version, you should always remember to add. if you `modified -&gt; add -&gt; modified -&gt; commit`, only the first modificaiton can be submit.you should use `modified -&gt; add -&gt; modified -&gt; add -&gt; commit`## Delete file1. in the work place, just use `rm filename`.2. in the repository, use `git rm filename`, and then `git commit -m comments`if you found you delete sth which you don't want to delete in work directory, and use `git checkout -- filename` to recover to the latest version.## Check status- `git status` check the current status - `git diff` check what was modified - `git log` check the modification history - `git log --pretty=oneline` display nicely## Clone a repositoryuse the following command```bash git clone /path/to/repository if the repository was on a remote server, then use 1git clone username@host:/path/to/repository Version controlReturn to former version1git reset --hard HEAD^ HEAD is the current version(N) HEAD^ is the last version(N-1) HEAD^^ is the (N-2) HEAD~100 is the (N-100) version. HEAD is a pointer, that’s the reason why it’s fast if you want to go to any version. Return to current versionif you know the commit id, use 1git reset --hard commit_id you can just fill in several digits in the beginning, but you should be sure it’s digit is specific. if you don’t know the commit id, find it in the next section. Find commit iduse git reflog to view every record you input command. Undo modification if you want to undo the modification in work place, use git checkout --file, note the -- here, without which means switch to another branch. if file has not been put into stage, after undo, it’s as the same as in the repository if the file has been added in to stage, after modified (not add), and now undo it, it return back to the original format(before modification) in stage. In short, this command was used to return the file to the status of last git commit or git add . if you add file to the cache, but not commit, you should use git reset HEAD file (to unstage), then use git checkout --file to undo the modified file in workplace if you already commit to repository, you should return to the former version Remote repositoryAdd ssh connection to remote repository, please see the official website, andto add auto-launching ssh-agent. You can add more than one key from other computers(company, home, school). after setting ssh, then only you can push to your account. \note: in default git:// use ssh protocol while in http:// use https protocol, but the https is a little slow. Add remote repository login to github, create a new repo (as a backup or cooperate with others) relate local repository to remotegit remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository_name.git push local to remotegit push -u origin master the first time use -u and the following days you can omit this parameters.the first time you push to remote, it can not only push the master to the remote and also relate the master between remote and local Clone remote repository1git clone git@github.com:username/repository_name.git and cd into that repository, you can check it. Branchmain branch name master, HEAD ponits to master and master points to commit. If you create a branch yourself, the HEAD points to your newly created branch. Create and swith to a new branchuse one of the following 3: git checkout -b branch_name git branch branch_name git checkout branch_name Check current branchgit branch will list all the branches, the current branch will be marked with * Swith branchgit checkout branch name note: branches will not interfere, your file in subbranch will not be seen in new branch. Merge branchgit merge branch_name which was used to merge the denoted brranch to the cureent branch. there are several modes to choose. Delete branchgit branch -d branch_name multiple branch in git is encouraged. Conflictsyou may found conflicts if multiple branches has conflicts, in such case, fast merge cannot be done, you can use git log --graph to see the branch merge graph Merge optionsin general, when merge git will adopt fast forward mode where the information in branch will be lost if deleted. but we can ban such mode by –no-ff which will produce a new commit when merge. 12345git checkout -b branch_namegit add file_namegit commit -m "add merge"git checkout mastergit merge --no-ff -m "merge with no-ff" branch_name use git log to see the branch history(if you use fast forward to merge, there is no trace) in practice, master used to issue new version, so it should be stable, but you can use branch to carry the actual work in a group. Bug fixingone of the important usage of branch is to fix bugs.when fixed, you can merge and delete the temp branch if you want to switch from the current work you are doing into fixing a bug, then use git stash to save the current spot, waiting to restore and continue. then use git status to make sure the environment is clean, then create branch to fix bugs(but before that, make sure the root branch is your desire, if you want to fix the bug in master branch, then you should be sure that you are in the master branch before creating a sub-branch) switch back to the original branch and use command git stash list to see the working environment. you have two methods to recover the working environment. use git stash apply to recover, but the stash content will not be deleted, you need to use git stash drop to delete. use git stash pop you delete the content in stash when you recover the working environment. when there are mulitple stash, you can use git stash apply stach@{} to recover the designated stash. Add new featuresif you want to add new features, you have better create a new branch Delete branchuse git branch -d branch_name to delete a branch that has been merged.or use git branch -D branch_name to delete a branch that have not been merged. Cooperationuse git remote to see the information of remote repository. Or git remote -v for more specific information, which shows the pull and push address, without push permission, you will not see the push address. Push branchuse git push origin branch_name(default master) the branch can hidden in your local, which depends on your choice whether or not push to the remote Fetch back branchuse git clone git@github.com:vinkwok/repo_name.git when clone the remote repo, in default, you can only see the master branch.if you want to develop in a branch, you must create the remote branch to local, for example, use git checkout -b branch_name origin/branch_name Set relation between local and remote repositorygit branch --set-upstream branch_name origin/branch_name Pull branchgit pull Tagstag is a meaningful name which bind to a specific commit Create a tagadd tag git tag &lt;name&gt; if you want to add tag to last months’ commit, find the commit id and usegit tag &lt;name&gt; commit_id you can also use -a to denote tag name and -m to denote description.eg: git tag -a v0.1 -m &quot;version 0.1 released&quot; 3628164 use -s to sign a tag with private key. (GnuPG)please refer to google or GnuPG official docs for more information View taguse git tag to see the tagsuse git show &lt;tagname&gt; to see the tag information Manupulate tagto delete a taggit tag -d v0.1because the tag we create is stored locally, will not be automatically pushed to the remote. if you want to push a tag to remote, then usegit push origin &lt;tagname&gt;orgit push origin --tags (will push all the tags that is not in remote) if you want to delete the tags of remote, delete locallygit tag -d v0.9 delete remotelygit push origin : refs/tags/v0.9 login to github to see whether this tag has been deleted Use githubunder your account clone repository \git clone git@github.com:your_account/bootstrap.git pull request in Github to request the official repository for modification acceptance Self define gitColorgit config --global color.ui true Ignoreadd those files to .gitignore eg: 12345678910111213141516# Windows:Thumbs.dbehthumbs.dbDesktop.ini# Python:*.py[cod]*.so*.egg*.egg-infodistbuild# My configurations:db.inideploy_key_rsa then submit .gitignore to repository, git ignore templates some times you really want to add some file to repository but it was ignored by .gitignore, you may use -f to add forcableeg:git add -f App.class Check .ignore fileuse git check-ignoreeg:git check-ignore -v App.class to see what kind of rules to ignore the file.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The simplicity and conciseness of Markdown syntax make it easy to write some ordinary documantation. But sometimes you may need something cooler where the basic syntax of markdown may not be enough. Luckily, you can write HTML in a markdown file. contents are extracted from ref1 …why I think HTML code is kind of ugly 1. Breif intro to HTMLHTML ( HyperText Markup Language, a.k.a “How To Meet Ladies” a geek joke from Silicion Valley ) is a standard markup language used to create web pages. Compare to coding language, HTML is a set of markup tags used to describe a webpage. A typical HTML file usually ends up with .html or .htm which can be viewed by a browser. For example: 1234567891011121314&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;title&gt;My title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;My first header&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;My first paragraph&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: claims as HTML5 document, “html” is case-incensitive. &lt;html&gt;: root, defines the whole HTML document. &lt;head&gt;: contains meta data as &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; and define the coding format as utf-8, sometimes you run into a messy code, check the coding format. For more info, please refer to ref2 &lt;title&gt;: contains the title of the document &lt;body&gt;: defines the main content &lt;h1&gt;: defines a heading &lt;p&gt;: defines a paragraph The architecture of HTML can be described as PS: only the body part will be displayed in webpages. 2. Tags in HTMLThe tags is formatted as &lt;keyword&gt;, eg &lt;html&gt;, and should be paired, eg &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;, which is called the opening tag and close tag respectively. Though Tags is case-insensitive, but lower case is usually preferred. 2.1 Heading and paragraph2.1.1 Headinguse &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;, use heading only if you want to set a heading, not for the bold or size purpose. eg: &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt; 2.1.2 Paragraphuse &lt;p&gt; to start a new paragraph, if you want to start a new line without starting a new paragraph, you can use &lt;br&gt;, eg: &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt; \&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;br&gt; a &lt;br&gt; paragraph&lt;/p&gt; 2.1.3 Othersuse &lt;hr&gt; to set horizontal line in contents. use &lt;!-- --&gt; to add comments, which is ignored by the browswer and not shown &lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt; when displaying, browser will automatically remove extra space and lines in HTML files empty elements contains no content, it was closed by / in the opeing tag, like the image above, also &lt;br /&gt; as a break. 2.2 List ordered list : &lt;ol&gt; unordered list: &lt;ul&gt; self-define list: &lt;dl&gt; # for more info item of list: &lt;li&gt; an example of nested list123456789101112131415&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tea &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Black tea&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Green tea &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;China&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Africa&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; Coffee Tea Black tea Green tea China Africa Milk 2.3 Linksuse &lt;a&gt;, href is link address , set target=&quot;_blank&quot; to open the link in a new Tab, eg: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vinkwok.github.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This is my blog link&lt;/a&gt; use id to create a bookmark within the HTML page, eg: &lt;a id=&quot;tips&quot;&gt;Tips&lt;/a&gt; \&lt;a href=&quot;#tips&quot;&gt;Go to tips in the same page&lt;/a&gt; \&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runoob.com/html/html-links.html#tips&quot;&gt; Go to tips from the other page&lt;/a&gt; 2.4 Tablesuse &lt;table&gt; to define a table, use &lt;tr&gt; to define a row, &lt;td&gt; to define a cell (‘td’ means ‘table data’), &lt;th&gt; to define the header. Example: 1234567891011121314&lt;table border="1"&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Header 1&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Header 2&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;row 1, cell 1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;row 1, cell 2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;row 2, cell 1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;row 2, cell 2&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; Header 1 Header 2 row 1, cell 1 row 1, cell 2 row 2, cell 1 row 2, cell 2 for more information about boarder, title, cell spanning, cell spacing, refer to blog 2.5 Images&lt;img&gt; is an empty tag, name and size is defined by the attribute. eg: &lt;img src=&quot;/images/logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;logo&quot; width=&quot;258&quot; height=&quot;39&quot; /&gt;use src to show the pic, use alt to replace the image with text when image cannot be displayed, use height and width to denote the length and width of the image (usually a good habit to do so) 2.6 CSS styleUsing CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to “Rendering”. How to add CSS to HTML? Include style in &lt;&gt; I am so handsome 2.7 FrameworkTODO 2.8 ColorsTODO 3. Elements’ attributesThe addditional information of elements, the attributes is usually contained in opening tag, consists of name/value pair, eg:&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vinkwok.github.io&quot;&gt;This is a link&lt;/a&gt; for more attributes, refer to ref3 4. Text formatting4.1 Bold and italic &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; &lt;italic&gt;italic&lt;/italic&gt; \&lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;em&lt;/em&gt; bold italic \strong em here the former and the latter is the same, but the latter usually means you want to empahsize. 4.2 Size &lt;big&gt;big&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;small&lt;/small&gt; big small 4.3 Delete and insert &lt;del&gt;blue&lt;/del&gt; &lt;ins&gt;red&lt;/ins&gt; blue red 4.4 Sub and sup script C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;C2n how to set the sub and sup for the same element 4.5 Control space and line using pre123456&lt;pre&gt;pre tagcontrol space and lines&lt;/pre&gt; pre tag control space and lines other format please look into the example of ref4]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Summary of Type-I/II error and confusion matrix]]></title>
    <url>%2Fposts%2FSummary-of-Type-I-II-error-and-confusion-matrix%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[When we make decisions, we are not guranteed to be right all the time. (actually I usually make wrong guess in multiple choice during exams). There are two types of “wrong”, misjudge the True to be False (false positive, Type I error), or misjudge the False to be True (false nagative, Type II error). In hypothesis testingWe define $H_0$ as the null hypothesis, and : Type-I error: reject $H_0$ though it’s true Type-II error: not reject $H_0$ though it’s not true for all scenarios: &nbsp; &nbsp; Actual Situation &nbsp; &nbsp; $H_0$ is true $H_0$ is NOT true Statistical Do NOT reject $H_0$ correct decision 1-$\alpha$ Type-II error $\beta$ Decision Reject $H_0$ Type-I error $\alpha$ correct decision (power) 1-$\beta$ Note: power is to reject null hypothesis when it’s not true In machine learningWhile for a binarized classification question (to judge whether it’s true or false), there is not always a consistency between prediciton and actual situation, where we have a confusion matrix: &nbsp; &nbsp; Actual Situation &nbsp; &nbsp; True False Predicted True true positive (TP) false positive (FP) Condition False false negative (FN) true negative (TN) There are some parameters you may often come across Parameters Formula Interpretation sensitivity, recall, or true positive rate (TPR) $\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$ ability to detect True specificity, selectivity or true negative rate (TNR) $\frac{TN}{TN+FP}$ ability to detect False false discovery rate (FDR) $\frac{FP}{TP+FP}$ misfound true precision $\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$ ratio of true positive in predicted positive Accuracy $\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$ correct prediction in all prediction. And the matthews correlation coefficient(MCC) is: $$ MCC = \frac{TP \times TN - FP \times FN}{\sqrt{(TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)}} $$ Note the difference between the sensitivity and precision, the former is how many positive you can detect in all positive, the latter is among all positive you predicted, how many is true. In my opinion, sensitivity is the ability to discover, while precision is the ability to control the discovery unique. (specificity). In real world, we can not always achieve good in both sensitivity and precision. Now it’s intriguing to think, given a method, what will determine the sensitivity and precision? I would say, the threshold. In fact, any statistical decision is made based on a threshold (like p-value &lt; 0.05). It’s the same here, different thresholds give different sensitivity and precision. If the threshold is too low, a lot of cases will be intepreted as positive, the sensitivity is high but the specificity will be low. On the other hand if threshold is too high, a lot of positive cases wil be missed, the sensitivity is low but the specificity will be high. So how do we determine the threshold to achieve the best combination between sensitivity and presion? We can trace the changes of sensitivity and specificity as the threshold changes. If we plot the sensitivity over 1-specificity (plot true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate), we can get the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC). Similarities between these 2 topics one more thing related to the precsion. But it’s about the numerical precision. Just think of that 1/3 is a finite decimal fraction when using the base of 3, which means that whether a decimal is a repeating decimal depends on the base it use. Considering MoreOne interesting topic is considering asymmetry of these 2 type errors. For example, sometimes the type-I and type-II error are not of equal importance. Especially in disease diagnosis, usually The cost of misjudging a heathy person is tolerable, but the cost of misjudging a disease person is usually high (may cost a life…). So it’s very important for threshold choosing to control the type-I and type-II error, Luckily we can use Neyman-Person Criterion to address such probelm.

If you put \left in front of an opening delimiter and \right in front of a closing delimiter, LATEX will automatically determine the correct size of the delimiter.1$$ 1 + \left(\frac&#123;1&#125;&#123;1-x^&#123;2&#125;&#125; \right)^3 \qquad \left. \ddagger \frac&#123;~&#125;&#123;~&#125;\right) $$ $$1 + \left(\frac{1}{1-x^{2}} \right)^3 \qquad \left. \ddagger \frac{~}{~}\right) $$ Large onesusing the commands \big, \Big, \bigg and \Bigg as prefixes to most delimiter commands123456789$$\Big((x+1)(x-1)\Big)^&#123;2&#125;$$ $$\big( \Big( \bigg( \Bigg( $$$$\big\&#125; \Big\&#125; \bigg\&#125; \Bigg\&#125; $$ %this line does not show properly on web%$$\big\| \Big\| \bigg\| \Bigg\| $$$$\big\Downarrow \Big\Downarrow \bigg\Downarrow \Bigg\Downarrow $$ $$\Big((x+1)(x-1)\Big)^{2} $$ $$\big( \Big( \bigg( \Bigg( $$ $$\big| \Big| \bigg| \Bigg| $$ $$\big\Downarrow \Big\Downarrow \bigg\Downarrow \Bigg\Downarrow $$ Stack symbols12$$f_n(x) \stackrel&#123;*&#125;&#123;\approx&#125; 1$$$$\sum^n_&#123;\stackrel&#123;0&lt;i&lt;n&#125;&#123;j\subseteq i&#125;&#125;$$ $$f_n(x) \stackrel{*}{\approx} 1$$$$\sum^n_{\stackrel{0&lt;i&lt;n}{j\subseteq i}}$$ Bold Symbolsuse \mathbf, mathematical symbols are normally italic, and doesn’t work on lower case Greek letters1$\mathbf&#123;\mu&#125;$, $\mathbf&#123;M&#125;$ $\mathbf{\mu}$, $\mathbf{M}$ use pmb or bm.

The two commands\overrightarrow and \overleftarrow are useful to denote the vector 1$$\vec&#123;a&#125; \qquad \vec&#123;AB&#125; \qquad \overrightarrow&#123;AB&#125;$$ $$ \vec{a} \qquad \vec{AB} \qquad \overrightarrow{AB} $$ Arrays and MatricesArraysuse the array environment, with \\\\ command to break lines.1234567$$\begin&#123;array&#125;&#123;&#125;x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; \ldots \\\\x_3 &amp; x_4 &amp; \ldots \\\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots\end&#123;array&#125;$$ $$\begin{array}{}x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; \ldots \\x_3 &amp; x_4 &amp; \ldots \\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots\end{array}$$ the {} behind {array} denotes the format of elements, you can add r,c,l(right center left) and other format you like, for example, the code below shows the first and the second element are centered and separate with the third element with | which is also centered12345678$$ \left[ \begin&#123;array&#125;&#123;cc|c&#125; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\\\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \end&#123;array&#125;\right]$$ $$\left[ \begin{array}{cc|c} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \end{array}\right]$$ Matrixuse &amp; to separate elements in one row, and \\\\ to separate rows simple matrix123456$$\begin&#123;matrix&#125; a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d\end&#123;matrix&#125;$$ $$\begin{matrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d\end{matrix}$$ matrix with delimiterchange the parameter in \begin{...}, \end{...}.

But we cannot do that here as the KATEX cannot support euqation environment right now. There are many things that the current KATEX cannot support. Hope the developers release the new version ASAP.

Quoting codecall out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. 1use `git status` to... Use git status to list all new or modified files that haven’t yet been committed. To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks in the beginning and the end. Some basic Git commands are:123git statusgit addgit commit Linkshttp://github.com - use address directly, automatic forms the link!or create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ), you can also add a tag of the link (the words that appear when the mouse hangs over it), just use &quot; &quot; to embrace the tags after the link, the tag and the link are seperated by . 1[Github](http://github.com "github") GitHub Section linkslink directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose the link. 1[header](#header) header Relative linksdefine relative links and image paths to help navigate to other files in your repository,A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. 1[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) ImagesFormat:1![Alt Text](url) online: url is the address to the img local : url is the path to the img, eg: D:/用户目录/图片/MIT.jpg Tabledividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |: 1234First Header | Second Header------------ | -------------Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2Content in the first column | Content in the second column First Header Second Header Content from cell 1 Content from cell 2 Content in the first column Content in the second column Task ListsTo create a task list, preface list items with [ ].
